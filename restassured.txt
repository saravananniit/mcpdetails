You are a senior Java developer. Generate a Java 17 Spring Boot project (Maven) that calls https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com using a WebClient-based service and includes TestNG tests.

Requirements:
- Java 17 (maven-compiler-plugin release=17).
- Spring Boot 3.x, spring-boot-starter-webflux for WebClient.
- Test dependencies: spring-boot-starter-test (exclude JUnit), TestNG, and RestAssured for API assertions.
- Configure maven-surefire-plugin to run TestNG via src/test/resources/testng.xml.
- Create DTOs as Java records for posts (userId,id,title,body).
- Service: JsonPlaceholderClient with methods: getPosts(), getPost(id), createPost(post), updatePost(id,post), patchPost(id,map), deletePost(id).
- Tests:
  1) API tests (RestAssured + TestNG): validate status codes and basic payload structure for GET /posts, GET /posts/{id}, POST /posts, PUT /posts/{id}, PATCH /posts/{id}, DELETE /posts/{id}. Include a DataProvider to try multiple IDs.
  2) Client tests (SpringBootTest + TestNG): autowire JsonPlaceholderClient and assert deserialization and key fields.
- Base URL configurable via application.yml (default: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com) and overridable via env var JSONPLACEHOLDER_BASE_URL.
- Provide instructions to run: `mvn -q -DskipTests=false clean test`.

Also include:
- testng.xml with two <test> groups (api and client) using package scanning.
- Negative test for a non-existent endpoint returning 404.
- Robust timeouts and simple retry (WebClient: set response timeout; RestAssured: request timeout).
- Comments explaining JSONPlaceholder is a fake API—POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE are simulated.
