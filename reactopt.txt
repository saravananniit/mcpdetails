**PROMPT 1: Identification & Analysis**

```
You are a senior React performance auditor. Analyze this React component comprehensively and provide a detailed performance assessment report.

YOUR TASK:
Conduct a thorough performance audit and identify ALL issues, inefficiencies, and optimization opportunities.

ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK:

1. RE-RENDER ANALYSIS
   - Identify what triggers component re-renders
   - Map the re-render cascade (which state changes cause which re-renders)
   - Identify unnecessary re-renders in parent and child components

2. COMPUTATION ANALYSIS
   - Identify expensive calculations and their frequency
   - Determine if computations are being recalculated unnecessarily
   - Assess the computational complexity of each operation

3. MEMORY ANALYSIS
   - Identify functions/objects created on every render
   - Detect reference identity issues causing child re-renders
   - Find memory allocation inefficiencies

4. COMPONENT ARCHITECTURE
   - Evaluate component structure and separation of concerns
   - Identify prop drilling or unnecessary prop changes
   - Assess child component optimization opportunities

5. DEPENDENCY TRACKING
   - Map out data dependencies (what depends on what)
   - Identify which optimizations would provide the most impact

DELIVERABLES:
Provide a structured report with:
- Executive Summary: Top 3 critical performance issues
- Detailed Issue Breakdown: Each problem with severity (Critical/High/Medium/Low)
- Impact Analysis: What triggers each issue and its performance cost
- Dependency Map: Visual representation of what depends on what
- Optimization Priority List: Ordered by impact (what to fix first)
- Specific recommendations for each issue with the React hooks/patterns to use

Format your response clearly with sections, bullet points, and code snippets where relevant.
Be specific about WHY each issue matters and WHEN it causes problems.
```

**PROMPT 2: Fine-Tuned Optimization (Use after getting the analysis)**

```
Based on your analysis, create an optimized production-ready version of this React component.

CONTEXT FROM ANALYSIS:
[Paste the key findings from the analysis here - the top 3-5 issues identified]

OPTIMIZATION REQUIREMENTS:

1. IMPLEMENT FIXES IN PRIORITY ORDER
   - Start with the highest impact optimizations first
   - Address each identified issue systematically
   - Ensure fixes don't introduce new problems

2. APPLY REACT PERFORMANCE PATTERNS
   - Use useMemo for expensive calculations and derived state
   - Use useCallback for function references passed to children
   - Use React.memo for components that re-render unnecessarily
   - Ensure all dependency arrays are correct and minimal

3. MAINTAIN CODE QUALITY
   - Keep the code readable and maintainable
   - Add clear comments explaining each optimization
   - Follow React best practices and conventions
   - Preserve all existing functionality

4. VERIFICATION APPROACH
   - Keep console.log statements to demonstrate improvements
   - Ensure the optimization is measurable
   - Test that all user interactions still work correctly

SPECIFIC IMPLEMENTATION GUIDELINES:
- For each optimization, add a comment explaining: what it does, why it's needed, what it prevents
- Use meaningful variable names for memoized values
- Group related optimizations together
- Consider edge cases and ensure robust dependency arrays

DELIVERABLES:
1. Complete optimized component code
2. Before/After comparison comment block showing what changed
3. Performance impact notes (what re-renders/recalculations are now prevented)
4. Any trade-offs or considerations for maintenance

Create production-ready code that solves the identified performance issues while maintaining clarity and maintainability.
